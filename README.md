# new_weather
An upgraded version of a weather web application I created previously. New features include hourly weather updates for up to 24 hours, geolocation and weather icons for better UX.
Built with React and Vite.
HOW TO USE:  
<img width="458" height="583" alt="new weather" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da186da-edcf-438b-b2d5-e4583e247b80" />
1. The app shows on default port-au-prince city as the default city
2. Type desired city in search bar to view results
3. Click the "seek" button to view results based on the user location. Note: you will have to enable location access to use this feature

   NOTES:  
Improved on my API fetching skills here.
Successfully added a geolocation feature to get weather details based on the user location.
Also added a weather scroll bar at the end to show hourly weather updates for up to 24 hours.
Also put icons based on weater info gotten from the API.
